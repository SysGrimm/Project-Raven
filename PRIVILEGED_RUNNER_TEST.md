# Privileged Runner Test - Build #25

Runner reconfigured with privileged container support:
✅ privileged: true in config.yaml
✅ Loop devices: --device=/dev/loop-control through /dev/loop7  
✅ Build containers inherit privileged access from runner
✅ Should resolve Pi OS image mounting failures from builds #23-24

Expected result: Loop device setup SUCCESS in build container
