# CRITICAL TEST: Build #26 - Corrected Config Format

Fixed Gitea Actions runner configuration with proper YAML syntax:

## Changes Applied:
âœ… privileged: true (corrected boolean format)
âœ… Loop devices in options array format (not single string)  
âœ… Proper YAML structure from generate-config template
âœ… Build containers should now inherit privileged + loop device access

## Expected Result:
ðŸŽ¯ Loop device setup should SUCCESS (not fail like builds #23-25)
ðŸŽ¯ Pi OS image mounting should work
ðŸŽ¯ SoulBox build should complete successfully

## Previous Failures:
- Build #23: Loop devices not available
- Build #24: Loop devices not available  
- Build #25: Loop devices not available (config format issue)

## This Test:
Build #26 with corrected privileged container configuration.
Runner config now uses proper YAML array format for device options.
