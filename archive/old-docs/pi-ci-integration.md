# Pi-CI Integration Plan for Project Raven

## Overview
Pi-CI provides a Docker-based Raspberry Pi emulator that we can use to:
- Test our configurations locally before building releases
- Expand Project Raven to support Raspberry Pi OS alongside LibreELEC
- Validate Tailscale integration in a virtual environment
- Automate testing with Ansible playbooks

## Current Pi-CI Capabilities
- **Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5 support** [SUCCESS]
- **64-bit ARM (ARMv8) Raspberry Pi OS** (Bookworm) [SUCCESS]
- **Base Image**: `2024-07-04-raspios-bookworm-arm64-lite`
- **Kernel**: 6.6-y
- **QEMU virtualization** with networking
- **SSH access** on port 2222
- **Export to raw .img** for flashing

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Testing Layer Only
Use Pi-CI to test our LibreELEC configurations:
```bash
# Test our config package in a Pi environment
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/test-env:/dist ptrsr/pi-ci start
# SSH in and manually test our scripts
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
```

### Option 2: Raspberry Pi OS Support
Extend Project Raven to support both LibreELEC and Raspberry Pi OS:
```
Project Raven
├── libreelec/          # Current LibreELEC support
├── raspios/            # New Raspberry Pi OS support
│   ├── configurations/
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── ansible/
└── testing/            # Pi-CI integration
    ├── test-libreelec.yml
    └── test-raspios.yml
```

### Option 3: Full Pi-CI Workflow
Complete CI/CD integration with automated testing:
1. **Build Phase**: Create configurations
2. **Test Phase**: Use Pi-CI to validate in VM
3. **Release Phase**: Export tested images

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Testing Setup
1. Create Pi-CI test environment for current LibreELEC configs
2. Develop Ansible playbooks to test our customizations
3. Validate Tailscale integration works in Pi-CI

### Phase 2: Raspberry Pi OS Support
1. Adapt our configurations for Raspberry Pi OS
2. Create Raspberry Pi OS-specific customization scripts
3. Port Tailscale integration to work with systemd

### Phase 3: Automated Testing
1. GitHub Actions integration with Pi-CI
2. Automated testing before releases
3. Multi-OS support (LibreELEC + Raspberry Pi OS)

## Advantages
- **Local Testing**: No need for physical hardware
- **Faster Development**: Quick iteration cycles
- **Multi-OS Support**: Broader hardware compatibility
- **Automated Validation**: Catch issues before release
- **Community Friendly**: Easier for contributors to test

## Technical Considerations
- Pi-CI uses Raspberry Pi OS, not LibreELEC
- Would need to adapt our configs for different base OS
- Tailscale integration may work differently
- Could maintain both OS variants in parallel

## Next Steps
Would you like to:
1. Start with local testing of our current LibreELEC configs?
2. Begin adapting Project Raven for Raspberry Pi OS support?
3. Focus on automated testing integration first?
