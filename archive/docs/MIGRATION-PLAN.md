# Project Raven - Raspberry Pi OS Migration Plan

## Migration Overview
**From**: LibreELEC (Media-focused, read-only)
**To**: Raspberry Pi OS (Full Debian-based system)

## Migration Benefits
- [SUCCESS] Full Debian package ecosystem
- [SUCCESS] Local testing with Pi-CI
- [SUCCESS] More flexible customization
- [SUCCESS] Better community support
- [SUCCESS] Easier development and debugging
- [SUCCESS] Standard systemd services

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup [SUCCESS]

### Directory Structure
- [x] Create `raspios/` directory structure
- [x] Set up `configurations/`, `scripts/`, `ansible/` subdirectories
- [x] Create initial documentation

### Basic Configuration
- [x] Create Raspberry Pi OS `config.txt` with media optimizations
- [x] Set up `cmdline.txt` for performance tuning
- [x] Design first-boot initialization script

### Pi-CI Integration Research
- [x] Clone and evaluate Pi-CI capabilities
- [x] Create test scenarios for our configurations
- [x] Document Pi-CI workflow integration

## Phase 2: Core Services Implementation [SUCCESS]

### System Automation
- [x] Create comprehensive Ansible playbook for system setup
- [x] Configure automated SSH security
- [x] Set up system optimization scripts

### Media Center Setup
- [x] Port Kodi installation to systemd service
- [x] Configure auto-start functionality
- [x] Set up user permissions and groups

### VPN Integration
- [x] Migrate Tailscale from LibreELEC add-on to systemd service
- [x] Configure IP forwarding and routing
- [x] Create connection management scripts

### Testing Framework
- [x] Implement Pi-CI testing workflow
- [x] Create automated test scenarios
- [x] Set up continuous integration testing

## Phase 3: Build System [SUCCESS]

### Image Creation
- [x] Create automated Raspberry Pi OS image builder
- [x] Implement multi-device support (Pi4, Pi5, Zero 2W)
- [x] Set up automated customization pipeline

### First Boot Experience
- [x] Design comprehensive first-boot setup script
- [x] Implement automatic service configuration
- [x] Create welcome message and system information

### Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive README for Raspberry Pi OS variant
- [x] Document build process and testing workflows
- [x] Provide troubleshooting guides

## Migration Strategy: Side-by-Side
- Keep existing LibreELEC support during transition
- Gradually build Raspberry Pi OS variant
- Eventually deprecate LibreELEC when feature parity achieved

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Core infrastructure and testing setup
- **Week 2**: Feature porting and media center setup  
- **Week 3**: Testing, refinement, and documentation
- **Week 4**: Release and community feedback
